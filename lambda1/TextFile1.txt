Exercise 1:
Write a lambda expression that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

Exercise 2:
Create a Func delegate that accepts a string and an integer as input and returns a new string that concatenates the input string with the input integer.

Exercise 3:
Write a lambda expression that takes an array of integers as input and returns the count of even numbers in the array.

Exercise 4:
Create a Func delegate that accepts a string and returns the number of vowels present in the string.

Exercise 5:
Write a lambda expression that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings with only the elements that have a length greater than 5.

Exercise 6:
Create an Action delegate that accepts an integer and a list of integers as input. The delegate should multiply each element in the list by the input integer and print the updated list.

Exercise 7:
Write a lambda expression that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list.
